### Hi there, thanks for visiting! ğŸ‘‹

I am Danny Pellatt. A full stack software developer living in Encinitas, California, USA. 

Proficient in a variety of programming languages, I'm adept at web development, managing relational and non-relational databases, utilizing server-side and client-side frameworks, leveraging version control systems, using APIs, as well as effectively testing and debugging across the entire development stack.

I graduated from Plymouth University, England as a Geology major and completed the TrueCoders boot camp in 2022, after which I quickly got a remote job as a developer at a tech company in Kentucky. I am currently open to offers for work.

## ğŸª• About Me

Originally from a small village in England, I moved to America late 2021.

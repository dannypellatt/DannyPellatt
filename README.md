After spending a couple of years as a Freelance web developer, I realized I am passionate about creating applications. This is when I threw myself into the work, creating as many projects as I could. I am currently open to offers for work.

## ðŸª• About Me

Originally from a small village in England, I moved to America late 2021. 

I enjoy music (I play 7 instruments!), problem-solving games (video, board and escape rooms), and travel (21 countries on 4 continents, 42 US states and 14 National Parks so far!)

I've always been passionate about learning new things and creativity. I believe this is the link between music and software development that has allowed me to always love my career.
